name: handoff
description: Create a compact handoff document for another agent to continue work. Use only when the user explicitly asks to hand off, transfer, or summarize work for a new session.
---

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS - not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, which suggests skills that the agent should invoke.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans,
ADRs, issues, commits, diffs, feature records, or progress logs). Reference
them by path or URL instead. When Harness Slim is active, cite the current
feature record and the relevant `progress.md` entry rather than creating a
competing work log.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
